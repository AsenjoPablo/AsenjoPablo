# Hi there! I'm Pablo 👋
Here is my [portfolio](www.asenjoserrano.com)

## About me
 - I used to be an English teacher, but I now work as a professional software developer.
 - I live in Spain. 🌞
 - I love videogames, sports and nature.
 
## What technologies do you use, Pablo?
I'll be honest... I 💖 learning new technologies. I tend to focus on the Front End of applications, but I can also deal with basic Back End tasks and mobile development.

___

### Front End 🚀
#### Angular
My main working experience as a developer has been using Angular.

#### React / NextJS ⚛
For my own projects I prefer using NextJS. It's just like React - but better.
_Note: I use Typescript._

___

### Back End
#### Node / Express / Nest 🐱
I started using Node and Express for MERN / MEAN applications, but I am now working on my NestTS skills.

#### Next
For some projects I just build the back-end on Next.

___

### Mobile 📱
#### React Native
I understand React Native's syntax and would be able to deal with basic development. However...

#### Flutter 🐦
... my main focus has been on Flutter. I can adjust apps to match a design and connect them to an API successfully. I am able to handle coding as well a low-code tools (mainly FlutterFlow).
 - I'm ex English teacher and web/software developer (self-taught).
